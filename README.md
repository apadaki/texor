# teXor

## Description

A Discord server bot which compiles LaTeX and renders a clear image.

## Usage

When in the same server as **teXor**, the command `!texor {LaTeX code}` will output the compilation of `{LaTeX code}`. Since this is within an equation environment, some environments and multilline commands do not yet work.

## Installation

**teXor** is not yet public so it cannot yet be installed or invited to a server.
